So what does LDA actually do?
This explanation is a little lengthy, but useful for understanding the model we worked so hard to generate.

LDA assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. Those topics then generate words based on their probability distribution, like the ones in our walkthrough model. In other words, LDA assumes a document is made from the following steps:

Determine the number of words in a document. Let’s say our document has 6 words.
Determine the mixture of topics in that document. For example, the document might contain 1/2 the topic “health” and 1/2 the topic “vegetables.”
Using each topic’s multinomial distribution, output words to fill the document’s word slots. In our example, the “health” topic is 1/2 our document, or 3 words. The “health” topic might have the word “diet” at 20% probability or “exercise” at 15%, so it will fill the document word slots based on those probabilities.
Given this assumption of how documents are created, LDA backtracks and tries to figure out what topics would create those documents in the first place.
